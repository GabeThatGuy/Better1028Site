## PASS Session Information
#### From **Patric Baciu**
Hi everyone, my name is Patrick and I will be your PASS leader for MATH 1028 this term. 
PASS is a program that provides free study and review sessions courtesy of Bethune College.
These sessions are entirely optional, but I found them extremely helpful when I was in your position as a first year student.
We cover learning strategies, practice tests, and review course content. Sessions will be bi-weekly on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 17:30 to 
19:00 and will be held on Slack.
Please join the Slack Workspace by using [this link.](https://join.slack.com/t/math1028pass/shared_invite/zt-119phngo6-F~vM99ZprGP1460fjzjCqA)
